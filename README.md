Project Title: Sonar Data Analysis and Classification

The accuracy on the training data is approximately 83.42%.
The accuracy on the test data is approximately 76.19%.
The logistic regression model demonstrates reasonable accuracy in classifying sonar data as either a rock or a mine. Further improvements and fine-tuning can be explored for enhancing model performance.
